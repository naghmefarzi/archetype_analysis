{"title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)", "plot": "Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with groundskeeper Rubeus Hagrid, deliver an orphaned infant wizard named Harry Potter to his Muggle aunt and uncle, Petunia and Vernon Dursley, his only living relatives.\n\nTen years later, just before Harry's eleventh birthday, owls begin delivering letters addressed to him. When the abusive Dursleys adamantly refuse to allow Harry to open any and flee to an island hut, Hagrid arrives to personally deliver Harry's letter of acceptance to Hogwarts. Hagrid also reveals that Harry's late parents, James and Lily, were killed by a dark wizard named Lord Voldemort. The killing curse that Voldemort had cast towards Harry rebounded, destroying Voldemort's body and giving Harry the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead. Hagrid then takes Harry to Diagon Alley for school supplies and gives him a pet snowy owl whom he names Hedwig. Harry buys a wand that is connected to Voldemort's own wand.\n\nAt King's Cross, Harry boards the Hogwarts Express train, and meets fellow first-years Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during the journey. Arriving at Hogwarts, Harry also meets Draco Malfoy, who is from a wealthy wizard family; the two immediately form a rivalry. The students assemble in the Great Hall where the Sorting Hat sorts the first-years into four respective houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Harry is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione, while Draco is placed into Slytherin, a house noted for dark wizards.\n\nAs he studies magic, Harry learns more about his parents and Voldemort, and his innate talent for broomstick flying gets him recruited for the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the youngest Seeker in a century. While returning to the Gryffindor common room, the staircases change paths, leading Harry, Ron and Hermione to the third floor, which is forbidden to students. There they discover a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy. On Halloween, Ron insults Hermione after she shows off in Charms class. Upset, she spends the entire afternoon crying in the girls' bathroom. That evening, a giant marauding troll enters it but Harry and Ron save Hermione; they make up and become close friends after Hermione takes the blame for the incident by saying she went looking for the troll.\n\nThe trio discover that Fluffy is guarding the philosopher's stone, a magical object that can turn metal into gold and produce an immortality elixir. Harry suspects that Severus Snape, the Potions teacher and head of Slytherin, wants the stone to return Voldemort to physical form. When Hagrid accidentally reveals that music puts Fluffy to sleep, Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to find the stone before Snape. Fluffy is already asleep, but the trio face other barriers, including a deadly plant called Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys, and a giant chess game that knocks out Ron.\n\nAfter overcoming the barriers, Harry encounters Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Quirinus Quirrell, who wants the stone; Snape had figured this out and had been protecting Harry. Quirrell removes his turban to reveal a weakened Voldemort living on the back of his head. Dumbledore's protective enchantment places the stone in Harry's possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for resurrecting his parents, but Harry sees through his trick and refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry. When Harry touches Quirrell's skin, it burns Quirrell, reducing him to ashes. Voldemort's soul rises from the pile and escapes, knocking out Harry as it passes through him.\n\nHarry recovers in the school infirmary. Dumbledore tells him the stone has been destroyed to prevent misuse, and that Ron and Hermione are safe. He also reveals how Harry defeated Quirrell: when Lily died to save Harry, a love-based protection against Voldemort was placed on him. At the end-of-school-year feast, Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded extra house points for their heroism, tying Gryffindor for first place with Slytherin; Dumbledore then awards ten points to their housemate Neville Longbottom for having had the courage to stand up to the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns to the Dursleys for the summer, happy to finally have a real home at Hogwarts.", "characters": ["Ron Weasley", "Albus Dumbledore", "Minerva McGonagall", "Rubeus Hagrid", "Severus Snape", "Petunia Dursley", "Vernon Dursley", "Lily Potter", "Quirinus Quirrell"], "actions_dict": {"Minerva McGonagall": ["Deliver", "Teach", "Observe", "Support", "Witness"], "Rubeus Hagrid": ["Deliver", "Reveal", "Give", "Accompany", "Protect", "Help", "Tell", "Care for"], "Vernon Dursley": ["Receive", "Refuse", "Flee", "Learn", "Disapprove", "Deny", "Reject", "Treat", "Return"]}, "all_actions": ["Care for", "Accompany", "Deliver", "Flee", "Learn", "Return", "Observe", "Deny", "Support", "Teach", "Reject", "Refuse", "Give", "Treat", "Disapprove", "Reveal", "Tell", "Witness", "Receive", "Protect", "Help"]}
{"title": "A New Hope", "plot": "Amid a galactic civil war, Rebel Alliance spies have stolen plans to the Death Star, a colossal space station built by the Galactic Empire that is capable of destroying entire planets. Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan, secretly a Rebel leader, has obtained the schematics, but her ship is intercepted and boarded by Imperial forces under the command of Darth Vader. Leia is taken prisoner, but the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO escape with the plans, crashing on the nearby planet of Tatooine.The droids are captured by Jawa traders, who sell them to the moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their nephew, Luke Skywalker. While Luke is cleaning R2-D2, he discovers a recording of Leia requesting help from a former ally named Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 goes missing, and while searching for him, Luke is attacked by Sand People. He is rescued by the elderly hermit Ben Kenobi, who soon reveals himself to be Obi-Wan. He tells Luke about his past as one of the Jedi Knights, former peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic, who drew mystical abilities from the Force but were hunted to near-extinction by the Empire. Luke learns that his father, also a Jedi, fought alongside Obi-Wan during the Clone Wars until Vader, Obi-Wan's former pupil, turned to the dark side of the Force and murdered him. Obi-Wan gives Luke his father's lightsaber, the signature weapon of the Jedi. R2-D2 plays Leia's full message, in which she begs Obi-Wan to take the Death Star plans to Alderaan and give them to her father, a fellow veteran, for analysis. Luke initially declines Obi-Wan's offer to accompany him to Alderaan and learn the ways of the Force, but he is left with no choice after Imperial stormtroopers murder his family while searching for the droids. Seeking a way off the planet, Luke and Obi-Wan travel to the city of Mos Eisley and hire Han Solo and Chewbacca, pilots of the starship Millennium Falcon. Before the Falcon reaches Alderaan, the Death Star commander Grand Moff Tarkin has the planet obliterated by the station's superlaser.[5] Upon arrival, the Falcon is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam, but the passengers avoid detection and infiltrate the station. As Obi-Wan leaves to deactivate the tractor beam, Luke persuades Han and Chewbacca to help him rescue Leia, who is scheduled for execution after refusing to reveal the location of the Rebel base. After disabling the tractor beam, Obi-Wan sacrifices himself in a lightsaber duel against Vader, which allows the rest of the group to escape. Using a tracking device placed on the Falcon, the Empire locates the Rebel base on the moon Yavin 4. Analysis of the Death Star schematics reveals a weakness in a small exhaust port leading directly to the station's reactor. Luke joins the Rebellion's X-wing squadron in a desperate attack against the Death Star, while Han and Chewbacca leave to pay off a debt to the crime lord Jabba the Hutt. In the ensuing battle, Vader leads a squadron of TIE fighters and destroys several Rebel ships. Han and Chewbacca unexpectedly return in the Falcon, knocking Vader's ship off course before he can shoot Luke down. Guided by the voice of Obi-Wan's spirit, Luke uses the Force to aim his torpedoes into the exhaust port, causing the Death Star to explode moments before it can fire on the Rebel base. In a triumphant ceremony, Leia awards Luke and Han medals for their heroism.", "characters": ["Luke Skywalker", "R2-D2", "C-3PO", "Han Solo", "Chewbacca", "Darth Vader", "Grand Moff Tarkin", "Owen Lars", "Jawas"], "actions_dict": {"C-3PO": ["Flee", "Land", "Be captured", "Be sold", "Be cleaned", "Travel", "Be hired", "Return", "Be captured", "Flee", "Celebrate"], "Han Solo": ["Hire", "Fly", "Flee", "Protect", "Care for", true, true], "Chewbacca": ["Travel", "Fly", "Protect", "Care for", "Flee", "Care for", true, "Celebrate"], "Darth Vader": ["Give", "Capture", "Protect", "Teach", "Destroy", "Attack", "Observe", "Reveal"], "Grand Moff Tarkin": ["Give", "Tell", "Destroy", "Capture"]}, "all_actions": [true, "Care for", "Accompany", "Deliver", "Flee", "Attack", "Learn", "Return", "Observe", "Deny", "Destroy", "Support", "Teach", "Reject", "Fly", "Be captured", "Refuse", "Give", "Hire", "Treat", "Be sold", "Land", "Be hired", "Disapprove", "Reveal", "Capture", "Tell", "Be cleaned", "Travel", "Witness", "Receive", "Celebrate", "Protect", "Help"]}
