Members of the community were forbidden to aid or abet the outlaw in any way lest they suffer the same punishment as the outlaw. Being outside the protection of the law meant they had no legal rights, meaning anyone could kill them with impunity. The outlaw could not live in the community but was forced to flee to the wilderness or another country to try to survive until their sentence of outlawry expired or their relatives could somehow lift it. In the medieval era, an outlaw was known as a 'wolfshead'—equated to a wolf in the eyes of the law, to be hunted down like one.",
